## **SALES TRANSACTION ANALYSIS**<br>
1. This dataset contains detailed sales transaction records, including customer details, product information, pricing, discounts, sales amount, and profit.<br>
2. I cleaned the data by filling missing values and correcting inconsistencies to ensure accuracy.<br>
3. I calculated averages for key columns and highlighted values above average for easy analysis.<br>
4. Additionally, I applied star-icon conditional formatting on the Profit column to visually represent profitability across orders.
